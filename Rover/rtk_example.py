*** FOR ILLUSTRATION ONLY - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE *** check out semuconsulting.com there was lots of text here. Follow their license.

modified to dump current position, accuracy and time of fix to /dev/shm/coords.txt
This is setup for an RTK base station at 10.10.0.9 or swap the commented lines and you can use rtk2go.com

install:
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pygnssutils
pip3 install typing-extensions
If it's not working, I have a vauge memory of running a factory reset on the f9 using the SEMU Consulting gnsutils gui app 'cause whatever I tried before this had it sending ood phrases? 
Must have gnssapp.py in same directory when you run this.
